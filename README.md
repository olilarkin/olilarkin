### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Oli Larkin. I'm a generalist audio programmer, and I've been making audio plug-ins since 2003. 

- Some things I'm interested in:
  - lowering the barriers to entry for audio programming
  - sound synthesis and music DSP
  - web audio
  - spatial audio

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m the lead developer of [iPlug2](https://github.com/iPlug2), a liberally licensed and simple-to-use cross platform C++ audio plug-in framework
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [Linux](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/issues/105), [CMake](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/issues/39), [Documentation](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/issues/470) for iPlug2. I'm also interested in working with some experienced modern-web coders [improving the integration of iPlug2 WAMs into other sites](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/issues/229).
