### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Oli Larkin. I'm a generalist audio programmer, and I've been making audio plug-ins since 2003. 

- I'm interested in:
  - making it easier for people to code audio-things
  - sound synthesis and music DSP
  - web audio and web assembly
  - spatial audio, ambisonics and VR/XR
  - DSLs such as [faust](http://faust.grame.fr) and [SOUL](https://soul.dev)
  - CI/CD automation and cloud development

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m the lead developer of [iPlug2](https://iPlug2.github.io), a liberally licensed and simple-to-use cross platform C++ audio plug-in framework

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with 
  - [Linux](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/issues/105)
  - [CMake](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/issues/39)
  - [Documentation](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/issues/470)
